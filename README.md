## Design and Implementation

For the user interface, I decided to use a minimalistic design concept and had therefore tapped on the ShadCN UI, which is a free component library that fits in nicely with the look and feel.

Since this app will interface with several APIs to pull the relevant market data for both cryptocurrency and stock, I separated the React components to handle the stocks and crypto data and display accordingly. This will avoid excessive manipulation of the data from the API in order to fit into the components, and allow me to customise where needed. TanStack Query is used to facilitate the data fetching with multiple APIs and overall state management.

Airtable is used as a simplistic and hassle-free database for the app to track holdings (although alternatives will need to be considered in future update in view of security and confidentiality). The tables and fields are tabulated as follows:

1. CoinsPortfolioDB

- idTicker (string)
- symbol (string)
- name (string)
- quantity (name)
- purchase_price (number)

2. StocksPortfolioDB

- idTicker (string)
- symbol (string)
- name (string)
- quantity (name)
- purchase_price (number)
